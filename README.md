# Bubble Tea League Stats Tracker

This website is used to make tracking stats for the Bubble Tea League (BTL) publicly available to the world with a pretty user interface.

Currently, all stats are tracked by hand by Danz which is a huge pain.

BTL is a community-organized League of Legends tournament league managed by a group of friends in their free time.
